# 📌 Two Pointer Technique

## 🧠 Concept:
Two Pointer technique uses two indices to iterate over data structure 
from opposite directions or different speeds.

---

## ✅ Problems Covered:
1. Two Sum (Sorted Array)
2. Palindrome Check
3. Palindrome Check (Ignoring Spaces)

---

## ⚡ Approach:
- Initialize left = 0
- Initialize right = n - 1
- Compare elements
- Move pointers based on condition

---

## ⏱ Time Complexity:
O(n)

## 💾 Space Complexity:
O(1)
